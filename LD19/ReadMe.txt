This is my Ludum Dare 19 Entry, City State: Inspired Destiny

This entry is dedicated to the memory of Carl Sagan.

The sky calls to us
If we do not destroy ourselves
We will one day venture to the stars

A still more glorious dawn awaits
Not a sunrise, but a galaxy rise
A morning filled with 400 billion suns
The rising of the milky way
